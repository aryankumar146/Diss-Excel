22-07-2019,"What “I” look for in a car, hmm. When I was working I wanted something that was fun to drive, sporty looking, and got good mileage. A Hyundai Elantra Coupe worked for me - it was comfortable, was nicely equipped (it was the upper SE trim) and had a manual transmission. And it had adequate power, barely.

Now I’m retired, so I wanted a fun toy to drive. So I got a Mustang Ecoboost equipped exactly the way I wanted it. It’s fun to drive, has a ton of power without being nuts (like GTs, Demons, Hellcats, Shelbys, etc.) and it is purposely equipped - luxury stuff I could care less about, this is functional and comfortable. It MUST have premium fuel so that’s what I use. I don’t drive like I did when I worked so the mileage is lighter (only at 9K right now after 1.5 years). Another reason I chose the Mustang is there is a ton of aftermarket aesthetic and performance parts available for it, so I’ve been making this car MINE. It’s fun to work on, fun to mod and a blast to drive. But this is probably not something for someone who puts a lot of miles on a car and has to have solid dependability for daily driving. Or for someone to whom a car is simply a transportation appliance."
14-01-2019,"For a daily driver, I look for features that fit my needs. AWD, decent cargo space, decent power, and good MPG not requiring premium fuel. All for a good value. And I now always avoid low profile wheels which is any rim size 17” and above. A decent stereo is important as well and if I can get a sunroof for a decent cost, that’s a huge plus.

Then I narrow my options down by researching the maintenance schedule of each to see how frequent the service is and how costly. I if course research overall reliability. This is what many people fail to research and will likely make or break how much you end up enjoying the car. I won’t buy a car that uses a timing belt. I won’t purchase a car with a CVT automatic. And I won’t buy a car that can’t go at least 5k miles between oil changes.

I also like to look in the engine bay. Some cars have very tight engine compartments and how the engine is designed can make simple maintenance very difficult and time consuming. Subaru uses boxer style engines where the cylinders sit at the bottom of the bay. This makes changing spark plugs a huge job. My old Subaru took 3 hours to change the plugs (having the right ratchet extensions would have helped a little). Meanwhile my new Tucson has so much room, I can have the plugs swapped in 20 min."
Apr-18,"without knowing your priorities, we don’t know what *you* look for - but can offer ideas that others might consider.

If it is for a new driver - then perhaps something with a GOOD safety record and a long bonnet - more likely to have a prang or two when new to driving so having a lot of space between the front of the car and your legs is not a bad plan. Also if you dent a 15 year old car three days after buying it, it is not so upsetting as if the car is worth £15,000

If you need to do hundreds of miles a week and NEED reliability, then something newer and if you are not in a VERY well paid job, you might want to consider fuel economy too. If you have some spare cash to invest and reckon the sums add up, you might even toy with an electric or hybrid car.

If you have a family, you might want a 4 /5 door car - rather than a coupe - enough room for the kids plus luggage or a “hot hatch” just for you and the occasional date? That may make a difference to what you want.

So it depends on how much you want to spend, how many people will be in the car, how many miles a week you will do, how important efficiency is…….

The list goes on - but without knowing your priorities, it is hard to offer guidance.

If you do decide on any given car, then it can be worth using Google - with a search term like:

Honda Civic 2008 (reliability OR review OR problems)

and then see if there are loads of good things or bad things being said about that particular year or model of car.

I just ran that very search and the second result seemed to reckon that make/model/year has a 4.5 out of 5 rating averaged out over 141 (at time of writing) reviews.

This way, if you start to “favour” a particular car, you can see what the reliability seems to be like."
14-11-2018,"Personally, I like to look for things that are easily grabbed and quickly sold.

Leave a bag from a big box electronics store? I'm grabbing that.

Leave your cell phone and/or GPS in the dash holder? It's now mine.

Expensive Helly Hanson winter jacket? That'll fetch me $25.00 on the street.

There's a million things that I look for in a car. Things of value that you, the dim-witted shopping mall parker, doesn't think of those things, never hides them, all because those people don't care to know the truth of criminal activity. Little do they know, I'm watching every move of every car and driver, ready to leap into action and look for things in a car."
15-03-2019,"Ample room, for me and the person behind me. That means, two persons of 2 metres tall sitting behind eachother. With headroom.

Good driving abilities, cruising speeds of 200 kmh, since I live near the Autobahn.

Nice entertainment systems, selfdriving capabilities if possible.

My ideal car would be a box van, where we could lie down or play cards during the trip, the four of us.

A selfdriven Mercedes Marco Polo Van would be nice."
15-04-2018,"I ask myself two simple questions.

The questions are:

Is it front wheel drive? No

Does it have a V8? Yes

From there I consider options and maybe color but I use those two requirements to guide all my other choices.

That’s what I look for in a car."
04-03-2019,"Start from how you are going to use the car, how much money per month you are prepared to part with on maintenance, fuel, etc.

Just for an example, for a long time, I was a fan of Toyota Prado for its looks without realizing that this is a perfect car for offroad and terrain while I barely leave the city and highway where Prado feels bulky and not at all sporty and cool. When I had a chance to drive that car on the road, it was a total disappointment compared to sporty crossovers I prefer driving, although I am still fascinated by Prado exterior. As a result, I am not considering this car anymore.

Then decide whether you will buy it new or used. There are very good reasons for the former and the latter so, for me, it is more a religious question I would say. I always buy used, letting the first owner pay 50% of the car depreciation during the first couple of years. Of course, that requires due diligence on the car you are buying, looking for fresh well-cared-for cars with low mileage but this is another story.

When buying a new car, try several makes and models, visit dealerships, sit in a car and have a test drive, preferably in the conditions you are going to use the car, be it a highway or jammed downtown streets."
07-09-2017,"I have never bought a brand new car and never will. Buying used has served me well. I almost never buy from a car lot as they are middle men to the previous owner who is the person I want to deal with and talk to. First thing to look at is that owner, ask them how long they owned it, ask if it has ever been in an accident. Original owner cars are desirable, someone who has had it less than a year is suspect...just why don't you want this car you just bought? Ask them things about the car, how it was serviced, if there is anything at all wrong with it that they know of. They either will know of some thing(s) or not, but it is good to get their input. What they say can be verified by a mechanic or their service records they should have kept."
06-05-2020,"Here are some factors that you should consider before you look to purchase a car.

Budget :

The first place to start is with the financial side of things: determining your budget and what type of car you can afford to buy with that budget. The reason you need to make this decision sooner rather than later is because it can be easy to get sucked into spending more money on a car once you begin to look at them. Instead, get your budget together and stick to it.

Safety features :

The most important factor that anyone should look forward to while buying a car is its safety measures. Always cross-check the government rules regarding safety norms more stringent for Four-wheelers and two-wheelers. There are various factors that need to double-check in it. According to the law, all cars should have dual airbags, ABS, reverse parking sensors, as a part of standard equipment. Also, check for, additional security features like Autonomous Emergency Braking and steering with Electronic stability control, among others.

Insurance :

As a first time buyer, your car insurance cost will be very high due to your lack of experience or driving history. This, coupled with higher prices for more powerful cars, could lead you to pay an awful lot for your car insurance. To make these things simple, we always suggest that a new car has to be bought with comprehensive car insurance. It is because it offers add-ons to cover the depreciation value of your car, and offers consumables cover, which includes, consumable items such as AC gas etc more.

Needs :

Next up, you need to think about how you will be using the car and what your driving needs are. If you are simply going to be doing a short journey to work and back each day, with the occasional weekend jaunt, a small, economical car could be the answer. Alternatively, if you are going to be going on longer journeys with regularity, you should be looking for a bigger car, and potentially a newer one, which will be able to handle such long drives without breaking down or costing too much on gas.

Monthly costs:

As mentioned before, running a car costs money which you must consider before choosing which make and model you will buy. Monthly costs include car insurance fees, gas, general maintenance such as cleaning, and annual service. Naturally, each car will vary in terms of monthly costs. Some are more economical than others, some are more likely to break down than others, and insurance costs vary from car to car. Make sure you have considered the monthly cost of your chosen car."
28-11-2017,"This is one of the most crucial criteria while choosing a vehicle. This one basically determines what how the car will serve. Is it a family sedan? Or even an estate? Or a tiny city compact car? Or quite the contrary, forest pick-up truck? I don’t think this criteria needs further advice on what body type serves what purpose. Now this is a dealbreaker to me. Every engine type has its own special purpose which it is typically not serving. The obvious example are diesel engines. Diesels were originally designed for the purpose of having huge amount of torque for relatively small engine displacement and therefore, towing some heavy things behind them. They also generate this torque in really low RPMs so running for hours and hours is not a problem for them. Thus trucks were born.COMFORT and ADD ONS

There’s not much to talk about here, if you want heated seats, go for them but try to limit all the add ons to what you will actually use. I’m deliberately using the word “use” because a heated steering wheel simply isn’t something one would need.

PRICE, obviously

Also quite speaking for itself."
24-05-2017,"1. Safety

The reason Me place this at the first position among the things to check for in a new car is that regardless of the engine capacity and all other fancy features, if the car doesn’t have adequate safety features, it could be a disaster waiting to happen given the kind of road accident statistics reported in India.

Did you know that your car should ideally have “curtain” airbags along with the normal frontal airbags to protect your head when there is a sudden impact? These are meant to drop down from the roof and protect the head from whiplash. You could even ask for knee-protection. Also, vehicles are crash-tested and then given star ratings for their safety features. A five star rating, therefore, would be the most preferred. Some of the other safety features that you should check for include:

A. Electronic stability control- this would prevent the car from spinning out of control and sliding sideways when you make a turn at high speed or you suddenly need to swerve, which occurs quite often on Indian roads.

B. Anti-lock brakes – these come in handy when you need to stop your car suddenly, by preventing the wheels from locking up and the car from skidding.

C. Safety alerts – There are different types of safety alerts available such as motion detectors that warn you if another vehicle or object is too close and cameras attached to the rearview mirror that alert you with an alarm if you get distracted.

2. The Engine

Now that you know that your car is safe you need to check the two other important things that Indians are interested in, which is – how fast can this vehicle go and what is the fuel efficiency? Both these aspects are determined by the engine. There are two basic things to check here – the overall displacement of the motor in litres and the number of cylinders in the engine. For instance, a small car would usually have a 1.6 litre four-cylinder engine, which is great for fuel efficiency but might not give you rapid acceleration, especially on an incline. On the other hand, if you have a powerful engine, like a 6.2 litre, eight-cylinder one, you can whizz past everyone else but end up having to cough up much more for fuel, because efficiency here would suffer. Ideally, pick something that is suited for the type of driving you do – if you will be stuck in city traffic, the rapid acceleration won’t be any use.

3. Transmission

So, how do you like your gears to function? Are you looking for automatic transmission, where once you put the stick on drive, the car does all the work for you? Or are you a traditional stick shift lover? Did you know that some of the newer models come with “semi-automatic” transmission, where the clutch is automated and you only need to move the gear stick? While the choice of transmission will really not affect the performance of the vehicle, it would affect the cost, and, of course, the fun element. So choose wisely.

4. Cost of Ownership

This is a vital parameter to consider. It is advisable to have a good heart-to-heart with several dealers and specifically ask for all other hidden and apparent additional costs you might have to bear before you make the decision. One of the most important of these is your car insurance. It is mandatory by law in India that every new vehicle comes along with appropriate vehicle insurance. Nevertheless, you need to protect your assets to the best of your abilities and motor insurance could go a long way, especially in times of unfortunate accidents. The good news here is that many insurers and dealers offer special rebates and offers when you buy a brand new car. So, make sure you check for this while negotiating the deal.

5. Warranties

While your car is brand new, concerns regarding maintenance and servicing are likely to be minimal. However, with use and wear and tear, it certainly helps to have the best warranty on parts. Check with your dealer because most manufacturers have jumped onto the bandwagon to give warranties of up to five years to assert their quality benchmark. You will need to check whether the warranty depends on the number of years or kilometers driven, as well as whether some extended warranties are available. There also might be a few initial servicing deals thrown in by the dealer. So, don’t hesitate to ask about them. This helps ensure the best maintenance and smooth functioning of your vehicle.

6. Depreciation

Keep an eye on how much the car you love will depreciate over time. After all, most of us will look to upgrade our ride or at least get the latest model sooner or later. If the resale value of the current vehicle isn’t up to scratch, you might not even come up with the down-payment for the next one. It is a fact that some brands and models retain their resale value despite the passing years, while others depreciate rapidly causing you to actually lose money at the time of selling them.

7. Reversing Sensors & Cameras

Tight parking spots have become the norm in Indian metros. The best way to ensure that you do it right, without getting a scratch on your precious asset, is to check for parking and reversing aids. Then there is the risk of dogs hiding under the car to warm themselves in winter or hide from the blazing sunshine in summer. Without front and rear sensors, we might just start driving without realizing that we are putting another life at risk. And just in case the sensors give false alarm due to proximity to a plant or tree, you have the camera to check whether there is anything in the way. There are also cameras that work better at night than others. So, check for those too.

8. Navigation

Navigational aids can come really handy when you go on a road trip or move to a new city. Today most high-end automobiles come with such systems as standard equipment, you could add on a navigation unit to any car that you purchase. Check for those that offer freebies, such as map upgrades.

9. Automatic Headlights

Many times you would have noticed car drivers either leaving their headlights on even after parking the car or driving without headlights because the dashboard is backlit anyway. Now you can avoid such mistakes with automatic headlights that switch on themselves when the light dims, like when you enter a long tunnel or under-bridge. They also switch off automatically when the car is parked and locked. So, say goodbye to dead battery woes because you forgot to turn off the lights at night.

10. Freebies & Add-Ons

Never shy away from asking the dealer whether he is willing to throw in any freebies if you choose to buy the car from them. Some might offer you free servicing for a prolonged period, while others might offer extended warranty on some parts. In an attempt to boost sales, both the manufacturers and dealers offer various add-ons to entice customers. See if you can get a rebate on the premiums for car insurance or even a free holiday! Then there are those that promise gold coins and all sorts of bells and whistles to add on to the brand new car to make it all the more swanky."
21-06-2020,"The first thing which I would look for before buying any car would be The Legroom.

I would prefer a car which has larger legroom because I would like to travel in a spacious and comfortable car. The second thing which I would consider is the mileage. Mileage is very important due to the prevailing circumstances in our country. The fuel prices are increasing drastically day by day. Especially if you are a daily commuter, mileage would definitely matter a lot. I would not expect great mileage, but at least a decent one.

Third, the price of the car. Price matters a lot. If I feel that the car which I am going to buy is value for the money, I would definitely go for it. I personally don’t prefer cars with a lot of features(sunroof, cooled glovebox, wireless charging, Auto A/C, Keyless Entry, Different driving modes, etc). Instead, I would look for sheer driving pleasure. It doesn’t matter even if it has a manual transmission.

Fourth, as I mentioned earlier, I don’t prefer cars with a ton of features. Especially the information on the Instrument Cluster such as the average fuel economy, distance to empty, power or torque meter, etc. These are literally distracting while driving. I would simply reject cars with all these gimmicks. They aren’t really very useful. All these features are just for showing off before your relatives and friends. A simple analog instrument cluster is more than enough for me. Fifth, I would look for the performance pleasure of the car. The performance must satisfy ME and not my relatives or friends. I would check if the car could give a good feel to me. I would like to give you an advice. If you think the car doesn’t suit your style and nature of driving, please look for another car even though it gives excellent mileage and has unbeatable performance. Whenever you sit in the car, you must feel excited to drive it and that’s what I call performance pleasure. Even though it is powered by a 100BHP engine, it doesn’t matter unless and until you get the feel and excitement of the car. The performance must be satisfactory for you.

Finally, I would look for the car’s user reviews. I would follow Facebook pages of the car’s owner’s group. This helps me to get an idea about the car. This is a very important aspect to be considered before purchasing a car.

These are the things which I would consider before buying a car. I don’t care about which brand it is, because I am buying the car not for showing off and for selling it at a good cost. I am buying a car for my convenience."
28-06-2020,"when shopping for a car I put fuel economy high on the list. Also reliability. So my shopping starts with a lot of online research.

For where I live and the work I do, All wheel drive is indispensable. I also like to balance all that with a bit of sportiness and performance if I can. So how it feels when I drive it counts for much too.

If I’m shopping for new, then warrantee coverage means a lot to me as well. After that, it comes down to the deal. Can I get it for what I’m willing to pay. Before I go out, I have a budget set, a maximum. I try to shop when I’m not in a must-buy situation. I try to always be prepared to walk away. My mantra is “there will always be another deal. Another car.”

if im shopping used, it’s different. I just shop through ads mostly, see something I like that seems appropriate, and doesn’t look overpriced, then google it. Read reviews, look for what people complain about. I look in online forums specific to that car model, and see what people complain about. Try to see if I need to avoid that model of car. After that if I decide after some research that I’m interested, I look at car. I look for rust first and where is it. Significant rust underneath or any on the body, I take a pass. Is the interior clean, do the floors feel solid. I listen to the engine and I look at it too. Not all engines are quiet, but it should have a pretty monotonous drone, that just increases in tone when the accelerator is pressed. No squeaks or rattles or knocks. I don’t want to see rust everywhere or dirt everywhere or grease or oil everywhere and I don’t want to see signs of any fluid leaks. I check the fluids before start up to make sure they are the right colour and don’t indicate any problems. No signs of coolant in the oil or oil in the rad, which indicates a major engine problem. The oil also shouldn’t smell at all like fuel and the transmission fluid should not smell burnt. If the whole car smells of transmission fluid, I walk away. If it smells at all like it burns any oil, I walk away. If I smell anything electrical I walk away. I check that everything electrical on the car is working. It should start and idle easily. It shouldn’t hesitate when put in drive or when accelerating. It should shift into any gear without difficulty and without any funny noises or thump. All the rest is does it feel right when driving and stopping, or does anything feel off or worn out."
29-12-2019,"Purchasing a car can be really enjoying and a difficult task too.one may get confused while choosing a car for himself, and this happens when you not consider the important key points while purchasing a car

All these confusions lead us to a wrong selection of car for that we sometimes regret in future,so here are top 5 things one must consider while purchasing a car which leads to a great happiness than regret.

1.Looks Its one of the most important thing one should consider before purchasing a car,i know many of you will now be thinking that everyone considers it but let me tell you a majority of persons just go for brand names and in that case even the ugly looking cars are sometimes bought at higher prices that are not worth.but to a great extent look depends upon personal choice.But it matters,so consider a better looking car that is in good dimensions and eye-catching.

2.Pricing and offers

Its one of the most important thing one should consider before purchasing a car,i know many of you will now be thinking that everyone considers it but let me tell you a majority of persons just go for brand names and in that case even the ugly looking cars are sometimes bought at higher prices that are not worth.but to a great extent look depends upon personal choice.But it matters,so consider a better looking car that is in good dimensions and eye-catching.
I know everyone of you consider it cause i know money matters the most,but think in other ways like sometimes we purchase a car that was not worth spending for due to lack of knowledge.

For example,if one purchases a hyundai creta over kia seltos,it's not worth spending for, coz kia seltos offers more advanced features than creta ,so one must see if the car he is purchasing should be value for mone car.

3.Rate of interest Majority of us buy a car through loan on emi's,so one must be well aware about the ongoing rate of interests of different financial firms and one must properly see the loan amount or the interest amount.
Consider a bank that offers low rate of interest.

4.Safety features There is a negligence among lots of customers in considering safety features for their car, infact many of us are not aware that what are safety standards and we even purchase a 0 star NCAP test car.
So safety standards must be considered in any car purchase cause life is more precious than money

5.Car comparison

"
20-05-2018,"Having just bought a car a couple years ago, bleh, I'll show you my process.

So at the start of it all we sat down and asked ourselves 3 questions:

What do we need a vehicle for?
What do we want from the vehicle?
How much are we willing to spend?
For us the answers were:

Family transport and light hauling.
Reliability, compactness, fuel efficiency, safety, and a big cargo space.
And less than $20,000.
All those answers meant we were looking at a lightly used hatchback or a small station wagon. Which meant at this time there were quite a few options for us, unlike when I got my last car about a decade earlier. At this point attrition kicked in: Chevy's only real hatchback was gutless, Ford's two hatchbacks had transmission issues people kept commenting on, VWs were too expensive for the most part, etc.

By the end of this we had a pre VW scandal Jetta wagon, a Mazda 5, and a Honda Fit to choose from. The Jetta was snapped up before we could see it so it came down to the Mazda 5 and the Fit. And that was a case of test drive both and then go home and sleep on it.

Becuase we really liked both.

The Mazda had good space, performance, and great seating. The Fit had decent space but snappier handling and very flexible seating. It also was smaller.

We went with the Fit.

And then shoved a dresser in it, moved a friend, and finally had a car that fit our small city mostly built before cars."
27-11-2017,"My criteria is in first of all what i use the car for, which size i should buy. Second thing i think about is it quite and comfortable ? Third thing is it reasonably reliable ? And fourth, is it worth the money asked for it ? Does it have any extras?

I purchased a Honda CR-V which was bought with P2P rental purposes in mind, so we got something spacious, reliable and with 4 wheel drive system. I quite like after owning it, it´s not the prettiest car out there, but it does everything quite well, some things feel a bit cheap in it, but in general it´s well made. (2007 model, executive version)

If pricing limit is not around my opinions change quite a bit, i do really like the Tesla Model S, it´s slightly down on quality, but think about it this way…this is Tesla second car - and it´s pretty awesome. The A4 paper-size screen is brilliant in the car, makes everything easy, the styling is superb and the tech is nice. Performance is just mind blowing. But one rule i have is to never go for the cheapest option cars of any range, rather buy the older model with more extras.

My personal choice is an old E-class Mercedes Benz (W124), i used to own one, and i have plans to buy me another one, they were made from 1986–1995 (some models vary like cabriolet ended in 1997 i believe), these have pretty much everything i look for in a car, the quality is superb, closing the doors makes a satisfying mechanic sound, a well maintained model will not have one thing that squeaks or rattles, they are quite, super comfortable with a nice suspension. Owning one today requires having many things replace because of age/wear , but i found it surprising that a 4 cylender model like E220 is not actually that expensive to maintain."
24-04-2019,"There can be several factors while buying it.

A few are :

Purpose : Decide for what purpose you are taking whether it is for family/official/fun/… Sort down the usage purpose on how many people travel on regular basis, on what kind of roads you are gonna ride, etc.

Budget : Decide your budget in which range you can afford for. Don’t exceed your budget much unless you find something too worthy in the higher versions. Try to get the best one in your budget.

Performance : Consider a good engine CC, power & torque while going for a vehicle. It decides how good your car can move head while pickup, rough terrains & typical Indian roads.

Petrol vehicles have a better pickup when compared to Diesel ones. Diesel ones need to maintained well & need to be used on a regular basis to be in condition. Petrol ones can be started with an ease even after days of not using it.

Mileage : Mileage is a main constraint for a family budget car. Look for the best one in the range of cars that you have in mind.

This is the one which should not make holes to your pocket.

Safety & Breaking :
Last but not the least !

In fact, the most important one.

Because, you need to be alive to ride your car right !? So, never compromise with the safety part.

Car with Airbags is a must. (Atleast 2 - one for driver & other for co-driver).

Choose the one which has a good breaking system like ABS or an equivalent one. A good breaking system can avoid most of the mishaps. etter avoid the base versions of any model. Most of the times they won’t be having any kind of safety specifications.

Go for the model which have the minimum/basic safety specs & a tougher build quality material.

Research & Reviews :

You need to enough homework before choosing your dream car.

Because, some well analysed reviews might change the perception of yours towards a car. It can be in a good or a bad way.

That is very important."
22-01-2020,"1.) I have to like it

2.) A certain amount of practicality (as in “an M5 has four doors and a boot”)

3.) Can pay for it in cash

4.) Not new, from a brand I consider acceptable (this is quite an obstacle)

There are still “dealbreakers”. In 2005, I was considering to replace my Alfa 156 2.5 V6 with a 159 3.2 V6 Q4 (four-wheel drive) two or three years down the road. Then I’ve read that this actually wasn’t an Alfa engine, but one from Holden (GM) which already killed it. Then there was a test which vaporised the corpse, so to speak. The 159 was no less than 400 kg heavier than my 156, and due to this the 3.2-liter with 70 more horsepowers didn’t really deliver better performance. To disperse the corpse vapour, average fuel consumption was in the range of 17 liters per 100 km, a third more than my already thirsty 156. Weight and performance would have sunk it either way, the fuel consumption might not have.

This time my sights are set on a Giulia QV, which in two years should be available below 40.000 euros. Admittedly, a 510-hp engine is rather useless for me since most of my mileage is driven to and from work, but almost 17 years with the 156 have bent me somehow - I want a V6 engine again, and the QV is the only Alfa featuring one. The 280-hp, straight-four, turbocharged Veloce with four-wheel drive is definitely the reasonable choice in pretty much every regard, but reason already had its fill with four doors and a boot. Can’t be reasonable all the time, or we’d all drive wheeled tranquilisers."

(a) Personal Use — If you want to purchase a car for personal use then go for comfortable and medium range or high range car.

(b) Commercial Use — If for commercial purposes then go for non-expensive and comfortable cars. As they will cover cost faster and also earns you good profits. Some options are :

• If you want to invest your car in Ola and Uber then you can purchase Hyundai i10, Swift Dzire (Base model) etc.

• And if you want to start you tour and travel agency then go for Toyota Etios (very comfortable), Swift Dzire (Mid-Range model), Innova, etc.

4- Petrol / Diesel — Decide which car you want to purchase a diesel variant or petrol :—

Petrol Variant — If you are purchasing car for personal use and you will not use the car for longer periods at a time then go for petrol versions.

Diesel Variant — If you are purchasing car for commercial use and will use the car regularly for longer periods then go for diesel variant. As diesel is cheaper than petrol so it will increase your profits.

5- Features of car — If you want to make your ride comfortable then go for a car having good features like auto climate, cruise control, controls on steering etc.

Other factors are safety features, no. of members in your family, design, colour, brand of the car, etc."
03-03-2019,"Without going on and on, which I could, here are a few things to keep in mind:

Budget. How much can you realistically afford? Don’t overbuy just because the salesman convinces you that the financing is cheap. It’s not!
Be careful. Don’t look at a car and base all of your decisions on a car just because someone else thinks it’s “the car for you”.
Sit in the car and make sure that it fits you. Often overlooked topic. How does your butt fit in the seat? Can you adjust the seat back into a comfortable position? Do your feet reach the pedals in a very comfortable position? Where does the seat belt ride on you? Can you use the rearview mirrors safely?
Sight-lines and blind spots. Can you see everything? A major cause of accidents is that drivers can't see what they are about to hit. Many newer car designs include sensors and cameras. Plan on getting used to using them.
What style car do you want? An SUV? A 4 door sedan? A pick-up truck? A sports car? An all-wheel-drive car? Be realistic. Find the style that you want. Do you want to be trendy or not? Do you want to express yourself through your car? How much fun do you get out of driving?
Don’t buy an all-wheel-drive car unless you really need it. They are more expensive and don’t get as good gas mileage. But, AWD cars are great if you have a use for it.
Cupholders. We live in a Starbucks world!
How important is cargo room?
And, read Consumer’s Reports. The best place to get unbiased car reviews. It’s interesting how they do their research on a car. They don’t sell advertising on the products that they review. And, so cool here, they have an undercover process where they actually purchase the cars that they review without letting the sales people know where the car is headed. Also, they review the cars with respect to how the normal driver is going to use them. They don’t care how much G-force it can do on a race track!"
17-04-2018,"It depends.

New or Used? This makes huge difference.

New: Good price. Compare it to other cars that were sold in the area. Do your research and go into it with the intention of walking away. As far as what to look for , id say just make sure there are no dings / chips/ dents . No noises when driving the car. Open the hood make sure everything is clean/ no corrosion on the battery terminals (my last new car had a bad battery and it was new) . Not much you can tell right away from a New car but it has a warranty.

Used: Depending on your price range and your expectations this could change. For instance if you buy an $800 car you wouldn’t complain about some scratches or rust etc. You just want it to drive and pass inspection if its required in your state. Check the turn signals , brake lights , clutch if it has one. headlights.

The hard to judge area is probably a used car 3–8 years old. In which case id spend some time figuring out what you want. When you find it , do some research on that exact model. Scour the forums for common problems and ask the seller if they have been addressed or if they have never had an issue.

Check the brakes , tire tread / wear , oil can tell you quite a bit. Pull a spark plug.
Test drive it . Make sure there is no odd noises or lack of power. Let it run for a bit , make sure the fan kicks on and it doesnt overheat. Smoke from the exhaust."
19-04-2019,"It’s the overall ownership experience (includes maintenance, reliability and brand value of the company/car).
It might be different for me if I am buying say for example a second car. I will look only for performance and a manageable service network.
Apart from the ownership experience, I’d like to consider whether that particular car model is successful or not. This might not matter to some but a successful model is comparatively easy to maintain and these models do have a great resale value. Say for example, Hyundai Creta. We all know how much successful it is. You won’t find that level of resale value in Mahindra TUV 3OO. This is the difference.
And you cannot ignore the mileage of the car. It’s directly related to your pocket. Though most cars now give acceptable mileage (within their segment of course) but still mileage considerations matter.
Engine, build quality and safety features."
06-11-2019,"The best choice of car for us is a combination of what works for us and what we love most. So, when we are facing to buy a car, we need to develop a self-selecting rule. Since choosing a car is more difficult for female, I recommend the following five steps. To put it all together, it’s constantly subtracting:

- Firstly, the budget. For car selection, price is the main premise. For example, if you have a budget of $30,000, what is. Your acceptable range? $30,000 to 35,000? This can rule out a large number of cars, generally 20 choices left.

- Second, the models. Sportscar? Sedan? SUV? You have to decide the big model, which again rules out most of the cars. Adding the chosen price, leaving 10 choices.

- Third, the brand. After the price and model are determined, you need to choose the brand of the car. For example, Japanese, German and American cars. Here, some of the cars are excluded and left with no more than 10 choices.

- Fourth, the integrity of exterior, interior and color. You can look at several choices. In. selected prices, models and brands. In horizontal comparison, there are usually 4 or 5 choices left.

- Finally, the displacement.

The mentioned above are the car-selecting rule that tends to be female and, if male, the performance should also be considered."
17-03-2018,"I have an array of vehicles so I will tell you why I bought each. My 2000 f150 2wd. Well I inherited it but it replaced my 89 f150 2wd. I used it as my daily driver and did some work with it on the weekends. If you want to haul things you need a truck. Next my 2000 Firehawk trans am. Not did I buy the wrong car for the intrnded purpose. I wanted a sporty car that I could take on road trips approximately 1–2 days in length. Ha. I drove it about 2 hours and realized my butt was taking a lot of bouncing around from it's firm suspension..it is fast though. So much so that I am afraid to drive it much as I cannot keep it under 100 mph most of the time. It just wants to be there. Doesn't feel dangerous at all. It sticks to the road and with the improved cross drilled slotted rotors and ebc brake pads it stops real nice too. Well that brings me to the gem of my fleet. A 2005 Mercury Montego. You wouldn't give this sedsn a second look but drive it and you know it's all about road trips. Set the cruise, relax with the AC on and when you get there you get there. It's the car for those trips I was talking about. Skip the AWD if your thinking about buying one. Have heard bad thongs about the cvt transmission they have thankfully mines just fwd. Well recently I finally plunked down some greenbacks for a replacement to the 2000 f150 I have been driving for years. She still drives well but she was rusty and doesn't do so well in the snow cone winter. My lady went on a road trip last year with friends and came back raving about the nice fx4 f150 they drove. So I was ready for a replacement for trusty but rusty f150 I had so when a friend posted he was thinking about selling his sharp looking black 2009 fx4 extended cab I scooped it up. Soon we will sell the rusty 2wd f150. She has been good to us but you have to let them go sometime."

This will help you narrow down your search of what exactly you are looking for.

2) Milage

One of important consideration to be made.

3) Power

Depends on where and how you wana drive it.

4) Saftey

ABS , Airbags.

5) Looks

choice can very from person to person

6) Features

Just dont get carried out by sub models ie E,EX,S,SV,V,VX .. See what you really want , you can upgrade your car anytime later .

8) After purchase Service

9) Maintaince

10) Never think of purchasing Discontinued models or models about to be discontinued .

T

11) Parts availability

12) Offers available during purchase."
24-10-2018,"The first feature which everyone looks for while buying a car is safety. Without safety no one will ever look to buy a new car. Let me list down the features which is required to buy a new car. As a beginner you should know what things are needed:

Check for the engines whether they are in a perfect condition
Check for how fast can this car go and the fuel capacity of vehicle
Check for the transmission as the gear operates automatically or manually depending on your needs
Ask for whether the warranty depends on number of years or kilometers driven and whether it can be extended or not
Check if the reverse camera or sensor is pre-installed or not
Confirm for any freebies or add-ons with dealer while buying a car"
03-04-2018,"While purchasing a car the following points are to be considered:

1.The on road price (including life tax,comprehensive insurance and other

taxes and expenditure)

2.Ground clearance of the car,as the humps on the road are unscientific,pot holes,conditions of the Bangalore BBMP road.Minimum of 200 cms are required

3.Length of the car to be considered for easy parking in the city areas.

4.Fuel efficiency i.e KMPL is to beconsidred

5.Safety feature like air bags,cross bars,breaking efficiency,EBD,uphill breaking and ABS are to be considered

6.Interior comforts,smoothness of the car, visibility and dashboard comforts are to be considered.

7. Take a test drive of different cars as per your financial affordability,compare the driving comforts,breaking efficiency etc.

8.Finally nearness of the service station to your house,for easy servicing shall be

worth considering"
25-05-2020,"I like sleeper cars(blends in with the public, but has much more power than it appears). The first thing I look for in a car is the engine. It must be powerful and it must be a proven engine, typically one used in a sports car or pickup. The next thing I look for is a 4 door vehicle with lots of leg and cargo space that has that ideal engine. Fortunately for me these types of cars go cheap on the used market as the market has moved away from sedans and wagons. So I usually end up buying one that is loaded and less than 4 years old for a bargain."
28-11-2019,"The most important thing to consider when looking at buying a car is your budget. You may want that gorgeous Bentley Mulsanne to glide you to work everyday, but you might only be able to afford this: After you determine how much you are willing to spend, consider some of the following questions:

How many people do you need/ want to fit in your car on a regular basis?
Do you want sit higher from the ground as in an SUV or do you want the low center of gravity found in most sedans and coupes.
How much trunk space do you need/ would you prefer a hatch or wagon?
Do you care if it’s performance oriented or do you just want to get around?
Would you rather a used and more luxurious car or a new and less luxurious car of equal price?
How long do you need the car to last? Should you pick the reliable and sensible option over the fun car that needs new parts every 5,000 miles?"
10-03-2019,"I would consider the following.

Type Of Car

Obviously you can't head over to showrooms or dealerships without knowing what you want

Practicality

Choose a Car which suits your work and the amount of load you would've to take everyday or every weekend. if you're having a family but want to have fun and go to grocery or mall every weekend, choose a Hot hatch (ex- Suzuki Swift) or a sport sedan (ex- Hyundai Genesis)

Fun

If you want only fun and do not care about the leg room, safety etc. You might want to go for a Sport Sedan or maybe a sports car.

Affordability

You need not to be a millionaire to afford a Nissan GTR or maybe a Mercedes GTS. Only thing you need to find is a trusted car dealing website where such cars are being sold for almost half price and only a decent amount of Kms driven.

Reliability

If you live in a country where Tata or Audis or etc. Are rare, expensive to maintain and find spare parts and planning to Buy one of those, then make up your mind because you'll spend your life importing the spare parts At a reasonably high price due to taxes ."
05-10-2017,"There is an awesome article in team-bhp for the same and I follow the same whener me or my friends are taking the delivery of a car. You can check below for the same.

ARTICLE: Pre-delivery Inspection (PDI) & Check List - Team-BHP

If you are mainly asking for buying a car (not delivery) you can consider the following aspects.

Of course, budget - at what max you can spend on a car.
List out different models that comes in the budget that you want
Test drive all the cars without any hesitation
Lookout different options like ABS, Airbags definitely for safety purposes.
Resale value of the car in future
Availability of services centers, parts of the car in nearby area you live.
If you opting for a loan, check with different bank interest rates as well."
28-04-2018,"We must keep following things in our mind.

Make sure that the car is not involved in any illegal activity.
Check the documents property.
Make sure the engine number of car is same as mentioned in the documents.
The car must be best according to our needs.
Don't buy too old models.
Check the engine condition.
Don't pay too high.
Pay according to the condition of the body, AC, engine, clutch plate and tyres.
Don't be too quick in buying an old car. It's not easy to find a good condition vehicle in a short period of time.
Prefer local area number car.
If you don't have good knowledge of vehicle, then first let a good mechanic check the car that you think of buying."
28-11-2017,"Criteria will obviously vary widely from one buyer to another, but for me personally…

Must have a lot of interior space. Enough to camp in, haul cargo, motorcycles and people with. This usually means a full-size van.
Must have enough power to pull a trailer with. This usually means a larger V8 engine.
Must not be too expensive. This usually means a used vehicle.
Must not have any body rust.
Should be easy to work on myself.
Should have good fuel capacity for decent range.
Should have a good service record, low miles and no accidents.
Finally, I lean towards things that are unique in appearance, but still cool in their own way."

- The vehicle’s reliability
- Expected maintenance over the lifetime of the vehicle
- Comfort
- Desired features (features can include fuel economy, type of interior, safety features, driving features, electric motor, etc)

I purposely did not mention safety as vehicles these days meet the necessary requirements to be safely driven on the road. Though your desired features may and can include additional safety measures."
07-04-2019,"Price..Brand…Color…Condition…Decide your price range…Decide the brand you think you want..Decide on several color options…(Never buy a dark colored vehicle)…Watch for condition…First glance look at tires, look at control pedals, steering wheel condition…mis-matched paint textures, color….dents…rust…if these items look good pop the hood and look closely for oil and anti-freeze leaks…I always look underneath at all costs(dirty knees?)…Finally test drive…if in doubt axe to take it in to a dealer for a “condition check”…usually $100."
30-10-2019,"To get a car it is important to take certain criteria under consideration. The automobile industry right now is at a rapid pace where the auto sector contributes 7.1 % of countries' whole GDP. As new cars are in demand soo much to get it more offerable to some people the used car market is growing widely too.
Some factors you have to consider while buying a car are-

Check out the interior of the car, the fabric and other features like the navigation system, USB port connection, storage space, etc. Make sure that you check the odometer. Check out the exterior of the car the panels, doors, glass, etc. Examine every aspect of the car before you take the key in your hand. Check out the engines.
Once you have inspected the car correctly take it for a spin. When you take for a test drive you would know the power of your car, the comforts and whether you should consider buying or go for a second choice."
19-04-2019,"Share are factors:

Reliability
Enough space (but I don't need a SUV)
Reasonable price (not over priced like Audi, BMW or Mercedes)
Well equipped
Comfortable
What are not factors:

Resale value ( I keep my cars for a long time=10 years)
Prestige: I have had Audi A6, BMW 530, Mercedes C-Class, but now I have a Hyundai and am very satisfied.
Sportiness: As long as it does up to 180 km/h and keeps up with the traffic, that's good enough for me."
23-05-2019,"I just about always buy used. I am not hung up on having a new car and they lose too much of their value in the first year.

First and foremost long term reliability. I do not replace a car until it is good and done and I want that to be at least 200K miles. Starting with a reliable car is important and that usually means a Toyota or a Honda though some other cars meet that criterion.

Second it cannot be too big. That is just me. I would love a Fiat 500 if it were not so unreliable.

Third it has to be safe. Then again, almost every car is reasonably safe these days.

Of course it has to be good on gas but if it is small it will be.

All of these will add up to value."
24-11-2018,"As someone who does triathlons and travels, I was looking for a car that I could put a full-size bicycle hard case in and close the trunk. This alone ruled out half of the sedans that did not have folding rear seats. Also, keeping a car on average 15 years to 20 years meant getting a very reliable model with low ownership costs. Lastly as this vehicle would be a commuter it had to get decent mileage in the city but also offer performance with comfort. Now when I mean decent, I am not talking about hybrid vehicles as to me the whole issue of batteries means another component to break, but something that not only gives me over 21 mpg but is fun to drive."
27-05-2018,"You need to take a pen and paper and answer the following questions.

Do i really need a car ? If yes, why ?
If the answer is NO then that's the end of it. If yes, and you are satisfied with the answer then the next question is how much are you comfortable spending.
Once budget is fixed you can go to websites like carwale or cardekho and see what all cars are available in that budget.
Do you need a hatchback, compact sedan, sedan, or crossover or SUV ? The answer depends on the places where the car is mostly intended to be used.
TEST DRIVE the car atleast twice or even thrice from multiple dealerships. No one can judge if you like driving the car except you. See the posture, height, seat comfort , visibility , engine driveability, ride quality, NVH, A.C. Etc.
Negotiate hard. If you're price conscious then take quotes from various dealerships and bargain hard for freebies or accessories. Take the dealerships track record in consideration. Do a thorough PDI from stockyard before you sign on the papers."
26-10-2019,"Everyone has a different criteria for a car. Find what you need, not what you want. If you need a pickup truck, don’t a buy Ford because it’s ”Ford” buy a reliable truck that you know you can afford and is easy to repair then save up to buy that Ford you love so much.

Personal story time: My first car was a modified honda accord and I loved it. However it got me in so much trouble (Actively and Passively) the police were called on me multiple times because I was driving around with a loud exhaust. It didn't help that I lived in a small town and got off of work late at night. I got pulled over almost every night. The car wasn't well taken cared of because I couldn't afford to.

A previously owned vehicle: new car depreciation is just killer
Well maintained, both the interior and under the hood
A good deal: the price compares favorably, or is on par, with similar vehicles on the local market at the time
Edit: Do your homework before you go look at any cars. If something doesn’t smell right, don’t be afraid to say no. As long as you have that money in your hand, you have more power than you may think. Take your time. Remember: you’re going to live with that car for years. You don’t get a prize for buying something quickly, no matter what the car dealer says."

For options a airco is a must and finding a car without powersteering these days is sheer impossible, cruise control is welcome but for the rest i don’t care, except a stereo i don’t need it, and what is not on it can’t break down .

Exterior. Check the body if theres any rust, dings. Check the tires if there is anymore thread on the tires.
Make sure you can afford and negotiate the price when buying your vehicle

How to check: open any door, there you’ll see rubber beading- pull it out and look carefully at small circles- these circles are put up by manufacturing units and they are spread across the body line of the whole car.. if some circles are missing that means the car has been repaired from the sides..

Similar circles are found in the boot too.

Now only the hood remains- check the underside of the hood for a thick gum like thingy and it should be spread from one end to the other.. if not- repaired!!

Then check how much the car is run on the odo and get it verified by the service centre.

06-03-2018,"I think about it as follows: I don't look at any specific cars first but try to follow this logic...

1. Start with working out a BUDGET. Whether you're planning to lease, hire purchase or just purchase outright this is probably the most important question to answer. If you're paying monthly, there are many calculators online that can assist you in working out a purchase price based on your monthly allowance. Don't forget to allow for fuel economy, type of fuel, maintenance and insurance in your calculations!

2. Next, decide whether you're buying new, lightly used/demonstrator/1 year old or just used. If you can eliminate one or two of those options then you're potential car options become narrower and easier to manage.

3. Make a list of what you NEED from a car (e.g. 4 doors, off-road ability, automatic transmission) vs. what is a NICE-TO-HAVE (e.g. Bluetooth). Everyone has differing priorities here - one person might absolutely need Bluetooth, whilst the next wouldn't even know if it was there. Once you've made this list, it's time to start looking at actual car options. Take point 1, 2 and 3 sequentially and apply them to a car catalogue, online car supermarket, car magazine or any resource which is comprehensive enough to cover most cars for sale.

At this point, I feel most people would already be at just 4 or 5 options. If you have more, then you've taken a wrong step somewhere - go back: is your budget range too wide? Have you not been specific enough in your needs? Are you SURE you don't mind whether a car is brand new or a decade old?

Some people might now be able to eliminate one or two options immediately based on past experience or brand perception.

You should now be down to 3 or 4 options. My advice...?

4. Go drive them all. Without sitting in them, driving them and being exposed to the sales team it is impossible to tease out or predict the differences between similar cars from different manufacturers. You will be surprised at how much 3 cars that are similar on paper differ in real life! With the 3 options freshly driven, hopefully one will stand out for being quieter, more attractive, or even just having a salesman who makes you feel at ease.

5. Lastly, if it comes down to it, get the one you will be proud to own. If you can turn back and look at it when you walk away or derive some joy from it after a long day's work, then all the better!"
06-04-2019,"Affordability, practicality and style.

First, and foremost, you need to shop within your budget. My sincere congrats if you don't have/need one of those. Never forget that along with a car purchase usually comes increased taxes and insurance.

Second is practicality. If you are a tradesman then a Miata may not be right for you. The vehicle should closely match how you plan to use it A commuter would probably want good economy while a tradesman would want a pickup or van.

Lastly, a last for a reason, is style. We all get romantic about shapes and designs that affect us whether it's a Corvette, a Porsche, an F-150 or a Beetle. The point is that you need to satisfy the first two criteria before you satisfy the third. If you are lucky enough to hit all three ""on the screws"" then you are indeed fortunate that your needs and tastes align. Further, if you are one who cares not a whit about style then the first two are easily obtainable among the myriad offerings of today's automobiles."
10-02-2020,"You have to look at yourself ...what kind of situation are you in (like single, married, married with kid on the way, married with kid or kids). That's a huge determiner of what kind of vehicle you should get. Obviously if you're unattached and single then the automotive world is your oyster. Really. Get whatever makes your pulse run faster. Or ....get what'll haul all your outdoor toys and get you to where the action is.

You can wade thru any number of online resources to get reviews and evaluations of just about any kind of vehicle ever made. Your part is to figure out what you want ...nobody can do that for you ...especially none of us becasue we don't *know* you. You know you so start there. You wanna sports car? 4-WD vehicle like a Jeep? A truck? Like I said, the automotive world is your oyster. And it's only a car. If you buy it, finance it, and decide you hate it ...well you can trade it in and start anew. Yeah, you'll take a hit in the wallet but these days with all the sales incentives it won't be too painful."
07-03-2016,"1. Decide what type of car you want. Coupe, sedan pick-up, SUV etc.
2. Decide what attributes are most important to you. Comfort, style, cost, handling economy whatever.
3. Pick at least three cars that meet your criteria, then check reviews on each. Reviews can be found on-line for just about anything. Check motor-head magazines.
4. Check into fleet/commercial use if any. Especially law enforcement and large corporation fleets. Cars selected are usually extensively tested before being committed as a fleet vehicle. Crown Victoria is prime example, used by Hwy Patrol, Gov agencies and taxi fleets.
5. Test drive and don't settle for the 15 minute sign and drive either. 12 hour minimum. If can't get dealer then rent one for a day from Hertz or whoever. Its worth it to find the little annoying things before hand.
6. Buy the car your wife wants."
10-03-2016,"Decide what type of vehicle you want first. Figure out what appeals to you in a way that you'll want to turn around and look at it when you leave it in a parking lot.

Figure out what will suit your lifestyle. Are you an outdoors person, do you have trailers to tow, will you be hauling supplies or anything? Do you want something fast and high performance? Do you want something luxurious?

Or do you just want something reliable that will get you to and from work?

Whatever you decide here, you'll be able to narrow it down to a few vehicles. Find some car lots that have those vehicles and go test drive them. Nothing makes a difference until you go drive them and see how they feel. Then buy the one you like the most if you can afford it."
30-04-2018,"Depends on what you like. People are somewhat split, in that they either like cars, or don't. People that like cars, usually have something they like about them, luxury, sportiness, size, speed, appearance, etc. People that don't care about them usually care more about reputation and reliability, and view cars as a necessary transportation appliance.

Some people end up liking cars that never really thought about it, and fall in love with what they buy and stick with it forever. Then there are the OCD freaks like me, who've owned pretty much every major car brand, plus many of the specialty brands, collected post war sports cars and some sedans, and ends up driving a boring generic pickup truck most of the time.

People like winners and losers, but in an industry that makes hundreds of different models with thousands of variants, there's no perfect car. There are likely many that will be good for you. If someone likes family sedans, then their experience using a Camry, Fusion, Impala, Altima, or Mazda 6 (or any others I didn't mention) will likely be the same. They are all nearly identical, other than the emotion people get all charged up with as it pertains to the brand they buy.

Same with SUVs or Pickups, or any class of car mostly. They are all so competitive, that theres more product differentiation in the marketing literature, than in the cars themselves.

Specialty cars are somewhat different. No one will mistake an Audi R8 for a Mazda Miata. But they are vastly different, and one cost 8 times the other. Same with a Corvette, or a Porsche.

So you need to ask yourself what you like. Speed or Luxury, Speed AND Luxury. Speed. Luxury. Space. None of those and just reliability.

Finally we don't know where in the world you are, but most car companies are pretty good these days. In the US, pretty much any car you buy will be a good choice, regardless of what people rattle off emotionally about the latest idiotic JD Power nonsense survey."
25-06-2019,"Drive it..

Attraction is blind, attraction is carnal. If its you who has to do the driving, take a test drive. They exist for a reason. Self clearing wind screen and space age sunroof will only get you so far if you don't like driving it. But yes, pay attention to safety ratings/features. Some people like plush comfort, others admire straight line performance. Personally I cannot resist back breaking, sharp handling cars.

So take a test drive.. these are only my 2 cents. Nadav, Ben and Michael have written objective and practical answers."
16-06-2020,"Assuming money is no option, because that is a big one . If so then look at your needs.

Is it for work or pleasure? Do you commute? Short or long trips? Do you have a family? Kids? A dog? What is the climate like where you live? Do you need air conditioning? Do you haul stuff? Would a half ton truck be useful to you?"
29-02-2019,"I’ll make the presumption that you are relatively new to driving and as such are possibly going to have a minor ‘dingle’, so do not buy new, the newer the vehicle the higher the repair costs.

Ideally get a good old ‘basic’ car from the 70s or 80s for a while, as these provide a better driving experience in the sense that you get more feedback and as such you will obtain a better understanding of road conditions, better still ride a motorcycle, your understanding will be even greater, the more modern the car the more remote you are from what what is actually occurring.

The MAIN thing is that it is ‘safe’ as in no major faults that could be the cause of an accident, so get any potential vehicles checked by a suitably qualified person prior to purchase, be aware that second hand is typically ‘someone else’s problems’ so it is also a good idea to keep a portion of your car budget and set it aside for maintenance, about 25% is a good safe figure.

Unfortunately buying new is NO guarantee that you will not have issues soon after purchase, so unless you have an unlimited supply of income, setting money aside at the start will put you ‘ahead of the game’ and help prevent any car purchase from becoming a real ‘nightmare’ and reduce it to perhaps just a mere inconvenience if or when problems do arise.

Buy a car you can own outright, car finance is for the gullible and the impatient, no car is worth the additional cost of paying interest on borrowed money.

The other MAIN factor is ergonomics, if you are tall this is going to be a real problem finding something suitable, look up relevant data regarding sitting ergonomically correct, you need to be in a ‘relaxed’ position for ease of control, this does not mean that relaxed so you can fall asleep, but relaxed in that you are not holding yourself in an odd or uncomfortable manner to operate the controls, it needs to be ‘natural’.

Too many tall (5? 10? +) people need to recline the seat too far back just to be able to see out the windscreen which then means they must hold the steering wheel at arms length, a rather tiring position, this also puts an ’unnatural’ angle on the neck and this can lead to problems down the track, neck/spine problems are not fun. This laid back position also puts the door pillars in your line of sight out the vehicle sides, blocking your view of potential hazards, the internal rear view mirror also needs to be in a position whereby it does NOT block ANY of your forward vision, again this is going to be difficult to find.

Too many cars also have the foot pedals far too close together, so you need a model that does fit you in this respect also, this will help prevent accidents."
21-02-2020,"Know the Invoice Price

Once you’ve settled on what car is right for you, look up the invoice price for that car in our Buyer’s Guide. Invoice price is what the dealer pays the manufacturer for the car; the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP, or “sticker price”) includes hundreds—usually thousands—of dollars of profit for the dealer. With the exception of all-new or very popular models, you should be able to get a new car for closer to invoice than MSRP. Knowing the invoice price of your car will tell the dealer that you mean business and expect a good deal. Don’t walk into the dealership without this information.

Check the Manufacturer’s Website for Rebates

Many buyers will qualify for multiple rebates, some of which may not even be made public. You might belong to organizations or receive coupons in the mail that entitle you to additional rebates. Be aware of all rebates for which you qualify and make sure you receive them. Dealers are known for not giving buyers every rebate available to them, instead keeping one or two as additional profit.

Research the Dealers

Buying from a cooperative and fair dealer will save you money and headaches. There are a number of websites that allow people to post reviews of dealerships, but their coverage is spotty and incomplete. If you can’t find online reviews of the dealer you are considering, just talk to people. Your friends and neighbors purchase cars and should be honest with you about whether they were happy with their car or dealer.

Check Your Credit History

Most people who shop for cars will need a loan. How much that loan costs will depend on your credit history, and knowing your credit history will give you a better idea what to expect from lenders. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act of 2003 (FACTA) allows every consumer to get a free copy of his or her credit report once a year from each of the three major credit-reporting agencies (TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax). Get a copy of your credit report, and check it for accuracy. Pay the extra few dollars to get your credit score as well, as it is one of the major factors that banks use to determine your creditworthiness.

Get Your Own Financing

The biggest profit center for a car dealership is its finance department. Dealers contract with banks to get the best rates available but might not actually give you those rates. They might get you a car loan for 4.9 percent APR but draw up your finance contract at 5.9 percent. That one-percent markup is strictly profit for the dealer. You can often get a better interest rate from your local bank or credit union, or you can present the rates you were offered elsewhere to your salesman and challenge him to match or beat them. That being said, promotional rates from manufacturers—sometimes as low as zero percent—can be tough to beat.

Time Your Purchase

Dealers run on a month-to-month basis. At the end of the month, many will accept lower offers to reach their goals and qualify for manufacturer bonuses. If you’re not picky about having the latest and greatest, the end of a model year is a great time to get good deals on remaining inventory. And December—particularly the last week before the new year—is a slow time for car sales, so if you can hack some time out of your holiday-shopping schedule, it’s a wise time to buy.

Also, most dealerships are busier on weekends. The weekdays are generally slow, especially in the morning. If you come into the dealership on a midweek morning when business is slow, the salespeople are more likely to make a good deal as well. They need sales and they want to look busy, which keeps them motivated to give you a better deal and earn your business.

Do Not Buy a Car on Your First Visit

Use the first visit to look at and test-drive the car(s) you are interested in. Gather your information and then leave, and be adamant that you will not be buying a car today. This will communicate to the dealer that you are not going to be bullied. Watch what you say to the salespeople—especially if they ask you how much you are prepared to pay monthly—because whatever you say will be used as a starting point from which the dealer will go up when negotiations eventually start.

Get Internet Quotes from Several Dealers

Get quotes from multiple dealers before you ever visit any of them. If dealers know they are being pitted against other stores, it will be easier for you to get their best offer right off the bat, and waltzing into a dealership with a first offer already in hand gives you an advantage in negotiations.

Make an Appointment with the Sales Manager

Once your research is done and you are ready to head to the dealership to purchase a new car, call ahead and make an appointment. By calling a sales manager to make your appointment, you communicate that you are serious about this transaction and know what you are doing. You will still be paired with a salesman when you arrive, but your chances improve of getting a straight shooter who knows you won’t be easy fodder.

There is no guarantee you will get a good deal on a new-car purchase, nor is there a set price to negotiate toward with any car; pricing always varies with content, age, supply, and demand. But following these rules will start you in the right direction to get the best deal possible on your new car."
12-01-2018,"One tip: You should know that’s it's even more expensive to buy a new vehicle than you thought. In fact, when you buy a new car, just the extra costs incurred ( compared to buying used.) will easily pay for a used car.

It's starts at the car dealer. When you buy a loaf of bread, do you see additional costs for “delivery” and “preparation” on the receipt? You will when you buy a car. You may also see financing charges (not interest, but a charge for the privilege of paying interest!). There are too many other dealer nickel and dime schemes to list. Like adding high profit, low value items such as “undercoating” or floormats. These little trips into your wallet add up to hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.

The government will want it's money too. Oh my, look at that sales tax/VAT amount. Depending on your jurisdiction the sales tax alone will pay for a nice preowned car.

Your insurance costs will be high, because you’ll want to protect your expensive “investment” against total loss and theft.

To make sure your new car warranty is valid, its best to have work done at the dealer, where labor rates are 50% higher than independant shops. In any case, you’ll have to make sure any repair shop is using “genuine” manufacturer parts -more $$$.

And then there’s depreciation. Yup, the moment your shiny new car leaves the dealer, it's a used car. Count on losing a nice pile of cash daily.

Buying a new model, first year release? Congratulations, you are now an unpaid beta tester for the manufacturer. Prepare for some fun times in court proving that the fault in your new model is a manufacturing oopsie.

I do visit a new car dealer occasionally and I get the sales person to fill out the paperwork (on a slow day at the dealer) just to remind myself how much money I've saved over the years buying used. I estimate it's about $100,000 so far."
10-02-2018,"When looking for a vehicle, I start with deciding what I can afford.

I then decide what my needs are, Car, truck, SUV, or ?.

Once I have decided what I can afford, and what type of vehicle I need, I then list all the cars that fit my wants and needs.

Next is research! I start reading everything I can on the different vehicles that are still on my list. Anything that does not have high marks in dependability are eliminated. Of the remaining cars. It all depends what problems the vehicle has as to whether or not it stays on the list. I buy a car to drive, not to get to know my mechanic better and contribute to his kids college fund.

At this point I get into performance. The vehicle MUST handle well, have very good brakes, and the performance. If any of these are substandard, they are off my list!

By now, my list is pretty short. I start driving what is left on the list. If it isn’t comfortable, or it just doesn’t seem to fit me, it’s off of the list.

Then I decide what options I need and which ones I want. Find the cars still on my list and check out their prices.

Only now do I let my feelings/emotions enter into the picture.

Using this system, I have been extremely fortunate in my choices. I can only think of one car that I don’t think was the best choice. I actually didn’t follow my system, instead I thought it was too good to pass on and I bought it. A very short time later, I decided to sell it off. The very next morning, on my way to work, the car caught fire and was totaled. Best thing that ever happened with that car.

I’m not saying my system is the best out their, but it sure has served me well. My system does take a LOT of time, but I enjoy it to the fullest, and the results are well worth it.

Sorry for the length of this response, but buying a vehicle is a huge investment, and this should not be taken lightly."
19-10-2019,"Based on your question about diesel vs petrol, I assume you're not in the US so some of the advice here could be a little off with respect to your exact situation, but not by much…

Can I afford this car? Note, I didn't say can I afford the payment on this car. The payment should go into your bank account each month. That's how you're going to buy your next car when it's time to replace this one.
Can this car do nearly everything I need? If you're married with four children, you'll obviously need something with more space than if you're single. Likewise, if you frequently have to carry large objects, your car will have to accommodate them.
What is the cost to operate this car? This probably goes to your diesel vs petrol question, and you'll have to decide. In the US, there are very few diesel models available, although the VW TDI Jetta / Golf get exceedingly good fuel mileage compared to most gassers on the market, the recent VW emissions scandal notwithstanding.
Once my warranty expires, how reliable is this car likely to be? Does this manufacturer have a great reputation (like Toyota and Honda), or is their reputation a bit more sketchy? For example, some people have great long-term reliability from Chrysler products but based on what I've seen, I would never take the chance on owning one outside of the warranty period.
Service plan - I assume you're talking about the manufacturer’s warranty? Sure, a longer warranty is to your benefit - as long as you don't have to pay for it. Never purchase an extended warranty, which dealers in the US typically push."
27-03-2020,"First thing you need to know is your need. You must know for what purposes you are buying the car
How much you drive, you are buying Car for you or your family, where you mostly drive( city or highway)
Once you have figured it out, its time for you to know your butdget
Now as you have some definite reasons to buy a car as well as you know your budget. Now you just checked the cars in your budget having the things you need
for 1500km or more/months » go for diesel
Only city driving, »go for a hatchback

Only highway driving» go for a sedan

Driving in village and bad roads» Go for an SUV

At last,If you budget is above 5.5 lakhs, buy a car having safety features e.g Airbags, ABS(Anti lock breaking system), EBD( Electronic brakeforce distribution)"
16-12-2019,"Having worked for a very long time in Automobile industry Make a note of following things,which a Dealer will never tell you:-

Buy a car from a reputed Dealer only.

Thoroughly check the papers you receive from the Dealers Insurance,Engine number ,Number,your name on the Papers,Address.

Some time when car is being Bought from Factory to showroom During Logistics the car get damaged ,which the dealer never tells,they simple swap the part of the car with old car.Bumpers,Engine parts, Bonnet,Electrical parts,you will never come to know this,only if you are an insider you are aware of this Practices.Sad to say buy Good dealer also Practices this sometimes…

Check the Discount mentioned on the sales invoice whether property printed according to you needs, incase of company purchase cars.

Thoroughly check the car before taking the delivery because,inspect for Dents,scratches.

Check whether accessories that you have ordered, have been fitted property or not on your car.

Avoid Buying Accessories from the dealership,it is low in quality and they sell it for high margin make 40–50 % margin by selling you this cheap Chinese made products.Buying only basic accessories is fine Mud flaps,matting which are genuine.

If you want to fit any electrical items in your car getting it fitted from your Authorized dealer only ,or else warranty will get lapsed.

When taking delivery of your car make sure you take delivery during the day time only between 9am to 5:30 pm. To make sure there are no scratches,dents,if any issue on the car body will be visible only during the day time, and easy to spot it."
20-10-2019,"Define your budget. How much money do you have now (down payment) and how much do you want to spend per month? I ALWAYS recommend living below your means. It leads to financial stability, having savings and investments.
Define what you want from your car.. As a consultant I use the acronym S.P.A.C.C.E.D, Safety, Performance, Appearance, Comfort, Convenience, Economy, Durability. If you can quantify the importance of each to your situation, it will help narrow down your options considerably.
Use the information from 1 & 2 to come up with a list of options, and then go check them out, see which fits what you are looking for the most.

Remember, there is no one right answer. I sell Hyundai's, they make a lot of sense, for a lot of people, but not everyone. For instance they have America's Best Warranty. That matters if you care about economy. Not everyone does.
In 2012 they had the lowest average cost of repair of ANY manufacturer according to carmd .com That matters if you care about durability/economy.

Now any manufacturer is pretty damn safe now, and very similar in safety features unless you spend a lot of money. So the biggest variation in safety comes in size class. It's physics, the more mass your vehicle has, and the more crumple zone, the safer it is.
Performance and Economy are basically opposites on a sliding scale. You could choose a 10 in performance, 1 in economy like a ferrari. Or a 10 in economy, like subcompact commuter car, that's a 1 in performance. Or a little compromise like say a Hyundai Veloster that I'd say is like a 3 in engine performance, a 6 in handling performance, and a 9 in economy. But you have to decide how important each is.

Comfort is entirely subjective, you have to see if you think the seat, interior, and ride is comfortable for you.

Convenience is also subjective. Some people like everything digital, some the more retro interiors. Some people like tech everything, some are happy with a working radio.

I can ask questions and narrow it down to a class and a couple great car options in about 10 minutes, that's the job of a Sales consultant. If you find a good one they can help you, just keep in mind they want to sell one of THEIR cars. And many old car salesman just want to sell you whatever car makes them the most money, so take everything with a grain of salt."
23-05-2019,"Your lifestyle. How much driving each week will you do? What kind of terrains will you be traversing? Do you have other transportation? Go for the dream car. Long distances, high miles? Might want something practical and reliable.
Affordability. Choose a car that won't expense more than 25–30% of your income, including fuel and maintenance.
Features. What kind of driver are you? Do you need or will you use certain safety features? Do you need creature comforts such as heated seats? Do you eat or drink a lot in your car? Might want to get easy-to-clean seats.
Dealer reputation and size. Buy-here/pay-here shops don't have a slew of technicians to run the safety inspections properly, or it is too expensive to get *all* of the car's needs fixed in order to make a profit. Publicly-held dealerships don't want negative experiences getting back to the stockholders so they will do most of the important stuff, even if it means decreasing the profit on a preowned car.
Future resale value. If you buy a rare vehicle, or one that isn't mass-produced, you can expect a decent future value if you take care of it. The more features a car has, often the higher the resale value is. Durable leather seats, for example, will hold up longer than fabric or cheap leather-like seats. The more adaptable a vehicle is to many terrains and lifestyles, the more likely it will be in demand when you want to sell it."
12-04-2020,"This is a very subjective question as buying a car largely depends on the affordability. So will try to give a precise and concise answer IMO. This is very specific to India.

Work out the budget. My rule of thumb is to limit the budget to 60% of annual income.
Shortlist all options within that budget. This is the mot subjective area. I know people who don't buy a Maruti Suzuki or a Tata by principle. A friend of mine hates Hyundai cars because he feels nauseous every time he is in one! Also, post sales service quality is ignored by most at great later cost.
From this list, remove any car without basic safety features like ABS or airbags. These SHOULD NOT be options - again IMO.
Now that you have a shortlist, cross check features against each of them. Example: You may want an automatic hatchback in which case Hyundai Grand i10 is a popular choice. But even its top variant has ZERO airbags. Another example: You might drive your car only in the city in which case keyless entry and auto folding ORVMs are very useful features.
By now you should be down to 3 or 4 options. Test drive each of those - with family if possible and make your choice!"
31-01-2018,"I look at what I need in a car first. I have a fairly big family. My Camry technically seats 5 but not really. Four is the realistic number of seats. Sometimes that’s not enough. The trunk is a good size but isn’t always big enough. So I have a larger SUV that seats up to 8 and has good cargo space. One of the first things I look at is if the car meets my seating and cargo needs.

I look at price. Can I afford the car? Am I choking on the price? It scares me looking at prices and thinking I might need $40–50k for my next SUV. <gulp>

I look at repair reputation. I don’t want a lot of maintenance problems. I bought the Camry because I had too many problems with the Chevy predecessor.

Those are the main things I look for. After that are things like appearance, does it have all the gadgets and features I want. What’s the drivability like. For the SUV, what is the towing capacity.

I am looking for a car that meets my transportation needs. I want a car that drives nicely, but I am not looking for a “driver’s car”, even though it sounds great. I also don’t want a tinny, rattling, underpowered econobox. I would like decent fuel mileage but not to the point where I don’t have enough size or power. I want a car that is very reliable."
18-01-2018,"It will be 5 different set of reasons depending on if the vehicle will be new or used.

If the car is new :

Nr 1 Practicality.

It should have place for everybody in our family and all our stuff in case of long journeys. It shouldn't be too long because of tight parking spaces where we live and it should have enough holders for our drinks.

Nr 2 Economy / Performance

It must be a diesel around 150-180 hp. I drive a lot and diesel economy helps to compensate the expensive taxes diesels pay in my country. Low end torque also helps in heavy traffic and full cargo. Top speed doesn't matter when you are driving with the family onboard. If it does 100mph is more than enough.

Nr 3 Extra options

I like comfort and gadgets. If a specific model gives me the chance to make my car more personal is a big plus.

Nr 4 Price

It's nice if all the above comes with a nice price and good paying options

Nr 5 Insurance and Services

The service interval is not an issue cos I'm going to service the car more often. I'm most interested for the service cost while the car is under guarantee because after that I will service it by myself. And of course the insurance cost is something I consider when I buy a new car.

If the car is used

Nr 1 Rust

The first thing I check on a used car. Rust is cancer and it can be only worse.

Nr 2 Engine noise

I'll listen to it both idling and while driving. Strange noises is an instant no-go

Nr3 Transmission

Nice, smooth transition to all gears. Strange noises is an instant no-go

Nr4 Steering and suspension

I listen for noises and vibrations.

Nr 5 Price

If I find something wrong with the car that is not mentioned in the add, I'll try to get the price down. If not, well, there's plenty of cars to choose out there"
16-09-2017,"When buying a brand new car, the two factors are majorily important:

Value for money
Suitable features to fit our needs
When you have a limited budget, first thing to do is note down all available options in the budget. Then compare differences, and identify the car that includes most of the features you needed in your budget. Test drive that car, and enquire about its service. If you like it, buy with peace of mind. You can also rely on online reviews and public comments, however there are many biased opinions roaming online."
10-01-2018,"Cost (obviously)
Tax & Registration Fees (not-so-obvious and caught me off guard a few times - either paying cash or negotiating a sweet deal on a new car in-state and then getting to Out the Door numbers and being like “where did that extra 10% come from?!” - a few times that has pushed me from ‘I’m excited to get this car!’ to ‘Screw this, I’ll keep shopping for something else.’)
Insurance (again, not-so-obvious and surprised me a few times *cough* Tesla *cough*)
Power/Performance
Mileage (as I’ve gotten older, I get more annoyed with needing to fuel up gas or electric cars ‘too frequently’, less than once a week so this is a factor for me now. I loved having a huge gas tank in my Raptor and it annoyed the bejesus out of me having a small gas tank in my GT500 and Focus ST - for example).
“Washability” - I like my cars to look good and don’t do automatic car washes so something that usually plays around in the back of my head is how intricate the exterior design is, especially around the grill and how hard it is going to be for me to keep the car looking nice. It’s never caused me to NOT get a car, just something I think about.
These are more or less in order, especially 1, 2 and 3."
12-09-2019,"Price, gas mileage, engine specs, and because it's new style.

Personally I look for a V6, they are usually the best engine for the streets, unless you're buying a truck gas mileage is important, and price should match its functionality. Style is a plus too.

Now if you're buying a car for fun, sports car or luxury, I recommend doing personal research and finding exactly what you want to buy, cars are expensive! It would be terrible to buy one you don't like."
14-10-2020,"A few key elements to consider:

Price.

Reliability.

Fuel economy."
12-06-2019,"Your intended use - city, country, trade, commuter, touring, sports etc.

Price.

Reliability if known or reliability of brand.

Price.

Comfort - you’ll be spending a lot of time sitting on those seats.

Price.

Diesel Vs petrol depends really on your use and the relative cost of diesel fuel and diesel option over the expected lifetime of vehicle.

Price.

Fuel economy is a big one - between vehicles, between diesel and petrol and the often overlooked cost of premium fuel if demanded.

Price.

Service plan is low on the list because if a good plan is not supplied your warranty is still upheld if you take your vehicle to an accredited mechanic.

Price.

If possible buy through a reputable dealer that will do warranty work without a fuss."

04-05-2019,"First of all you should be concerned that you need a brand new or used car then the budget. While discussing about budget, if you select a costly car then you should be known to its maintenance cost.

If you will use it more or drive too much then go for the diesel with a great fuel economy. Or if you will drive from work to home then petrol is good because the servicing and maintenance of petrol cars are comparatively lesser then the diesel vehicle but in case you drive too much then the diesel one good because you need a better mileage if you go long."
16-04-2019,"Price
Features it offers for the price you pay.
Comfort for your family members and you, mileage.
Colour, style, design and also the space it offers and also the boot.
Drivability it offers on most of the roads you drive.
Service and maintenance, long term review from the old customers.
Resale value should be considered because now a days if you feel this car is great one, you will be surprised with a new one in a month or two. So, while buying one make sure you love it even competition has better choices for you in future."
18-12-2020,"Drivability and low insurance are the most important things. Both of these features can often be found cheaply in old (early 2000s or before) cars. An added benefit of an older car is that it'll usually be easier to maintain than a modern one.

Get a car that's fun though. It should make you look forward to driving it and be disappointed when your journey ends. I've had this experience with a 1990s Toyota Corolla and a Ford KA mk1. I use these as examples because I own both but there are definitely other similarly good cars available. These cars are low powered so they're cheap to insure but light enough to be enjoyable to drive.

I would also suggest avoiding cars with ABS braking and any other assists. This may seem like a bad idea for an inexperienced driver but I believe that it's better to learn or gain experience in a car that does exactly what the driver wants and nothing else. If you learn the physical limits of grip and braking somewhere safe early on in a simple car then you will be a better, safer driver in the future even if you later 'upgrade' to a more modern vehicle."
12-04-2018,"how much you can make your monthly payment. If you can’t afford $500. a month stay away from experience cars.
Know the gas mileage of the car. Will it fit into your budget
Have some kind of idea on insurance coverage and how much it will cost you.
How many passengers can you take.
Do I want to shift or automatic transmission
What options do I want / need."
20-05-2020,"Make sure that the vehicle you are considering meets your needs, and yes, your wants. If you are on a budget, consider maintenance and insurance costs as well as purchase price and fuel mileage. if your prospective seller either 1. Cannot provide you with a paper history of maintenance performed, or 2. "
16-06-2017,"Features that you want. Seating capacity, wifi, blue tooth, hifi sound system, hard top, convertible, sunroof, leather, cloth, color, power seats, ergonimics, performance and fuel economy. This is just a few considerations. Are you paying cash or financing. Do want to keep a car for a long time or if you want something new every 2 or 3 years consider leasing."
21-06-2019,"f the new car that I am looking for is not an improvement over what I am already driving;what is the point of going for one in the first place!

Improvement on my existing car on these parameters:-

*Safety.

*Power.

*Drive-ability.

*Convenience.

*Snob value.

*Gizmos on offer.

Yes,there are times when our requirement changes over a period of time.That’s when we might consider going in for a vehicle which will offer us more in terms of space or flexibility."
28-03-2018,"It depends on how i plan to use it and with who~if its just for local commute then a sedan would do, if you plan to commute to long distances an SUV would probably be better. Also if you have a family or not would be a factor to consider, if you're gonna be you and maybe partner then a sedan is recommended, if you have kids then a mini van or SUV. For the finances, check the engine cc of the vehicle you plan to buy coz at least in where i live, the insurance tends to be expensive when your engine has bigger cc."
14-11-2019,"Depreciation. A motor vehicle is a depreciating asset. New or used it will be worth less when you sell it unless it's already very old.
The year and make and model are very important. Some companies make great reliable cars. But the first few years of a platform or model tends to be rough. And the last couple years of a given model tend to be near flawless because the manufacturer has addressed any major flaws.
If it's German, it's going to be difficult or expensive to maintain. If it's Asian or American, it feels like you never have to do much work. Like Ford for instance, I have two of their Mexican made cars and a ton of tools…but they never need any work.
If it's hybrid, you have to figure out how long a battery will last and how much it will cost to fix. Unless you drive a lot or drive in heavy city traffic, it's probably cheaper to just avoid hybrids ."
